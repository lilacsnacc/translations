#Decorus World Patchnotes

##TODO
- add json support to pull language-specific content during build
- look into having dev / live environments
- make 'translations' a git submodule, to make a smooth process for when we hire translators (translators can focus and 'pin' the translations repository to see changes)

##December 25th, 2021 v0.0.1
- have patch-notes compiler emit 'patch-notes.txt' to each language folder 'dist/{lang}', from 'translations/{lang}/patch-notes.txt'

##December 23rd, 2021 v0.0.1
- patch-notes compiler auto copies readme.md to 'translations/en/patch-notes.txt'

##December 22nd, 2021 v0.0.1
- correct some html elements with unecessary ids
- fixed bug with initial language settings
- changed selection color to something cuter :P
- created and linked privacy-policy pdf
- created and linked placeholder terms-of-service pdf

##December 21st, 2021 v0.0.0
- fill out the about the dev section and make a popup to display it

##December 20th, 2021 v0.0.0
- the latest patchnotes are now directly pulled from the m#ain repository readme during buildtime
- background video is #now auto-compressed in the server, so the serve size is minimal
- get the decorus.world domain working on new host.

##Notice to anyone with hopes
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) I've been working on this since Nov 2020, I just haven't formally written progress till now
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) DO NOT let the timestamps fool you or discourage you. I've made tons of iterations before this
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) If you're working on a game you believe in, please keep going! If you make a mistake, instead of beating yourself up, make up for the mistake!
