# Decorus World Patchnotes

## Note to Any Devs That Join
- Remember to run [npm init] when you clone this repo
- When you clone this repo, run [git submodule update --init --recursive] to get the translations folder contents
- Finally, run [git submodule update --remote --merge] once in a while to get the latest translations

## TODO
- enough! we need to hurry up. MVP only below ..........
- player rezzes on a small island (no wrapping, minimal heightmapping)
- player can walk around, jump, crouch, crouchwalk, and attack (bow, wand, or sword)
- player collides with trees scattered around the island
- player can open menu to view inventory and equipped items (i) (for now, all items are 1x1 sized items)
- player can open menu to view list of skills (k) (just list movement, crouching, jumping, and attacking for now. later on those will be hidden skills)
- player can open menu to view journal (j) (for now, just show how many crabs the player has clapped)
- player can open menu to view the shop (o)
- player can actually purchase a reflective egg from the shop
- the island has crabs for the player to fight
- Lilac Snacc, an npc sitting at her desk, can be chatted with
- crabs drop random items (bow, sword, wand, and some basic clothes for now)
- there are other players on the island
- players can safely chat with eah other
- player maintans their state even if they reload or log out, rezzing at the same place they were at before
- organizational / code
- organize animations instead of using anim[0] / anim[1] format
- move all model loading code into the Level class file
- future tings
- maybe we can somehow build the patch notes list from commits / commit messages???
- add json support to pull language-specific content during game
- look into having dev / live environments
- apparently we can handle hundreds, if not thousands of animated mesh instances easily! Just shadows kill fps. XD

## January 12th, 2022 v0.1.1
- added basic player model with soft texturing
- added basic stand and jog animations to the model
- organized the update code into Update and LateUpdate
- objects with Update methods can now tie themselves to the level's update listener
- standardized instancing / duplication for wrapped levels, and moved the code into the Level class file
- reorganized how move inputs are accepted and broadcast. Not quite happy with it but it works
- renamed overworld to infinite-plains. This is our first level! We'll revisit from time to time and decorate! ^_^
- added seedable randomness! This is the first step to repeatable / shareable / competitive dungeons! :D
- changed a few numbers around for the Entity class
- completed the infinite looping level setup (but boy is it graphically expensive T_T)
- fiddled with a few numbers for the camera system (lerp time, targetOffset, max render depth)
- waged a quick war on semicolons :P
- added fps counter so we can keep an eye on performance while we code
- I wrote this from top to bottom in one day, but this is the result of about two weeks of work!
- Working on making this a daily habit
- Enough dawdling! We need to hurry up and make an MVP for funding T_T bitches be broke and I'm not the starving artist type

## Notice to anyone with hopes
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) I've been working on this since Nov 2020, I just haven't formally written progress till now
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) DO NOT let the timestamps fool you or discourage you. I've made tons of iterations before this
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) If you're working on a game you believe in, please keep going! If you make a mistake, instead of beating yourself up, make up for the mistake!
- That's all. xoxox
