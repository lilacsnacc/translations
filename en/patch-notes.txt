## Notice to anyone with hopes
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) I've been working on this since Nov 2020, I just haven't formally written progress till now
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) DO NOT let the timestamps fool you or discourage you. I've made tons of iterations before this
- (Dec 23rd, 2021) If you're working on a game you believe in, please keep going! If you make a mistake, instead of beating yourself up, make up for the mistake!
- That's all. xoxox
