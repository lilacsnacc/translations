##ABOUT-THE-DEV-1
Hello! My name is Nazaire Shabazz, aka Lilac Snacc üòò (emoji optional). I'm an RIT grad who's been coding for almost a decade. Professionally for nearly 5 years now. Some of my favorite games are the .hack series, S4 League, Kingdom Hearts, and Forza Horizon 5.

##ABOUT-THE-DEV-2
Hmm... my favorite color varies every day, but right now it's #C5ABFF. My favorite food is sushi burrito üòã, and I'm really in the mood for cookies rn but my fav desert is chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.

##ABOUT-THE-DEV-3
Oh btw, my favorite flower is not actually the Lilac! It is the Lotus. Lilac is my favorite color though. But my favorite scent is Lavender. lol
